# Maintainers Guide

This guide is intended for maintainers â€” anybody with commit access to the `zeek-kafka` repository.

## Releases

All `zeek-kafka` releases first have a release candidate prior to being promoted to general availability.

In order to create a release, you must have `pipenv` and `python3` installed, and then run the following commands, where `$TYPE` is one of `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `build`, or `release`.

```bash
TYPE=major
REMOTE=origin

git checkout main  # Releases should always come from main
pipenv run invoke version $TYPE
git push --atomic $REMOTE $(git branch --show-current) $(git tag --points-at HEAD)
```

The previous commands result in a tagged commit containing updated version references in `zkg.meta` and `README.md` (as defined in `setup.cfg`) being pushed to GitHub, at which point GitHub actions performs the remaining release actions based on `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `.github/workflows/prerelease.yml`.
